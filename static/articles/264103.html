<p>
	For decades, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been the site of nearly unbroken conflict.
	It is a crisis that, by some estimates, has become the deadliest since World War II, with many
	millions killed.
</p>
<p>
	Capturing the weight of this in words is nearly impossible. Yet one group of artists and activists
	has spent years trying: Congolese slam poets, whose verses have become a tool of resistance and
	release for a new generation of young people in the country.
</p>
<p>
	To help share their perspectives more widely, The New Humanitarian has partnered with five
	slammers from eastern Congo — the region hardest hit by conflict — who have created new poems
	confronting the realities of war and honoring the strength of their communities.
</p>
<p>Their words have never been more urgent.</p>
<p>
	For the past three years, violence has escalated sharply in the east as a rebel group known as the
	March 23 Movement or M23 has launched one of the most destabilising insurgencies in years.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Entire cities have fallen to the rebels, forcing millions of people to flee their homes, including
	artists and slammers. It is one of the worst crises in the world in terms of humanitarian impact,
	yet global media attention has been desperately limited.
</p>
<p>
	Still, while many look away, the poets continue to speak out. Some of them are still living in
	eastern Congo –&nbsp;in the rebel-occupied cities of Goma and Bukavu. Others have gone into exile
	for their safety.
</p>
<p>
	All share a common purpose: to speak the truth of what is happening – and what it feels like to
	experience war and displacement.
</p>
<p>
	A performance-driven form of spoken word with bite, slam poetry began to take root in Congo a
	decade ago. Emerging from a vibrant local art and activist scene, it gave people a powerful way to
	speak out against injustice.
</p>
<p>
	Though the current conflict has upended their work, slam collectives in Goma and Bukavu have spent
	years not only writing and performing, but taking their art into the public sphere, visiting
	schools and raising awareness around social and political issues.
</p>
<p>
	The poems you are about to watch tell deeply personal stories — of exile, of the authors
	witnessing atrocities, of lives disrupted by war.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
	Some take a longer view, confronting the legacy of colonial exploitation and the ongoing plunder
	of Congo’s vast mineral wealth — cobalt, coltan, copper — by international companies and
	neighbouring states.
</p>
<p>
	All portray the violence that Congolese are forced to endure, while also celebrating the
	resilience of its people. “For over a century we've been dying,” says Patricia Kamoso, a poet in
	Bukavu, “but we're not dead. It's our greatest victory: We're not dead”.

<h2>Goma, my living dead city</h2>
<h3>By Soleil, in Goma</h3>

	In this piece, Soleil, who is using a pseudonym, speaks about pain and resilience in Goma, the
	biggest city in eastern Congo, while denouncing the violence inflicted on innocent people. Through
	a poignant message of hope, she shows that art is a healing tool, giving a voice to those who
	suffer in silence and reminding us of the importance of remembering struggles for justice and
	dignity.
</p>
<p>
	Though Soleil has chosen to be anonymous, she is a well-known member of the slam community in Goma
	having performed at major festivals inside and outside Congo. Her commitment to the cause of women
	and her ability to articulate daily struggles through her poems has sparked profound reflection
	among audiences.

	She said: “I wrote this text to put down on paper all the pain I can't bear and all the trauma we
	would like to erase from our minds. I wrote it to restore hope, to cry out on behalf of my entire
	community that suffers in silence. I wrote it so that even those who no longer believe in change
	would lean toward my belief in victory after a long struggle. Even as an artist, there is a
	particular way of looking at us, at other people. We can feel that they rely heavily on us, to
	heal their wounds through our words and to be their voices to claim their rights. That's why I
	wrote this text.”

	He said: “Between the inability to leave and the difficulty of staying. Between the desire to live
	and the obligation to adapt. Faced with a vague present and an uncertain future. I'm not here to

	resilient, and today more than ever; we must hope.”

	She said: “This text is a tribute to the dead and a celebration of life. I wrote it while
	traveling on a bus, where passengers were talking about what the war had taken from them,
	especially the people they had lost. This text embodies all the emotions I felt at that moment.
	During this time of war, this text is a way for me to honor those we have lost, but at the same
	time, to be grateful to still be alive. Because right now, we're all trying to survive.”

	He said: “This text bears witness to the suffering caused by the war in eastern DRC. It evokes
	shattered projects, stolen dreams, loved ones buried without tribute, and the silence surrounding
	the victims. It denounces impunity, political negotiations that ignore the victims, and the pain
	of survivors as a result of capitalism. It also speaks of the power of poetry, which heals inner
	wounds and transforms pain into resistance against hatred and violence. This text calls for
	justice, memory, and dignity to heal the scars of a forgotten people.”

<h2>To believe it</h2>
<h3>By Osée Elektra, in Tanzania&nbsp;</h3>
<drupal-media data-entity-type="media" data-entity-uuid="f4e08911-10cd-43c7-979e-6a22b2146da9"

<p>
	In the poem by Osée Elektra, writing becomes an act of resistance. Poetry, amidst chaos, restores
	hope and raises fundamental questions about the future. This slam calls for a world where art is a
	right and emphasises the need to continue writing, as an act of survival in the fight against
	injustice. The video was filmed anonymously while Osée was still in Goma, but now exiled in
	Tanzania, he is happy for us to use his name.
</p>
<p>
	Osée is a slam poet, rapper, and activist whose work has a unique style called "Slam Elektrik”,
	blending local folklore with contemporary sounds. Driven by a committed pen, he uses art to raise
	awareness and revive hope. Author of several singles and an EP entitled "Cocktail," he performs on
	numerous regional and international stages. Nicknamed "Soldier," he embodies an artistic voice of
	resistance and unity. He is also the artistic director of JUA-Asbl, an organisation that uses arts
	and culture to promote social engagement in the Great Lakes region.

	He said: "To believe it" is a slam of resistance born from the chaos currently engulfing the Kivu
	region, where writing becomes an act of survival and freedom. The text uses poetry to heal wounds,
	question the future, and give voice to those we want to silence. It dreams of a world where art is
	no longer a crime, but a bridge to peace. It is a cry of hope launched through metaphors. To
	believe in it, we write.”
