## Investigation Gaps

1. **Demolition contractor identities** remain hidden despite RTI efforts
2. **Current market value** of 18-acre holding (estimated ₹50-100 crore given airport proximity)
3. **SDLAC meeting records** - RTI denied, HBS was ex-officio member as Jalukbari MLA
4. **17 shell companies** - CINs, directors, addresses not yet fully traced
5. **JCB India supply chain** - did they supply directly to Assam govt?

---

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Appeal RTI denial** to Assam Information Commission for SDLAC meeting minutes 2006-2009
2. **GeM portal deep dive** - trace all Assam bulldozer/equipment tenders (IN PROGRESS)
3. **On-ground verification** - physical site visit to Bongora with GPS documentation
4. **Financial forensics** - Vasistha Realtors full balance sheet analysis
5. **Trace 17 shell companies** - identify CINs, directors, addresses
6. **JCB India investigation** - supply chain to Assam government
