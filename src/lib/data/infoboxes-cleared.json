			"In 1947, British India was divided. Bengal was split along religious lines: the west became India, the east became East Pakistan (later Bangladesh). Partition triggered one of history's largest mass migrations. Between 10 and 20 million people crossed borders. Up to two million died. Villages were cut in half.",
			"The Assam government encouraged Bengali Muslim peasants to settle on unwanted char lands and work tea plantations. Families were given land. They built homes. Seventy-five years later, their children hold Indian citizenship documents yet are labelled \"illegal Bangladeshis\" and evicted. Partition's violence continues through citizenship registers, eviction drives, and bulldozers."
